                       Version history of the RCWA package
                       ===================================

Initial version: 1.0.0 (April 26, 2005)

Changes between version 1.0.0 and version 1.0.2:

 - Several cosmetic improvements, no new functionality.

Changes between version 1.0.2 and version 1.0.3:

 - Added `View' - methods for certain group rings of rcwa groups and their
   elements (compact form to save space; not documented yet).

Changes between version 1.0.3 and version 1.1.0 (June 16, 2005)

 - The `Display' - method for rcwa mappings over the integers now recognizes
   an option `xdvi'. If this option is set, a LaTeX representation of the
   rcwa mapping is written to a file, LaTeX'ed and shown with xdvi.
   Try e.g. Display(Random(RCWA(Integers)):xdvi);.

 - An example `A group which acts 2-transitive on the positive integers'
   has been added. In this example, the transitivity of the given
   (wild) rcwa group is checked computationally.
