                           -- A GAP 4 Package --

                               Version 3.1.0

                                  Abstract

This package for GAP 4 provides implementations of algorithms and methods for
computing in certain  infinite permutation groups  acting on the set of inte-
gers.  In principle it can deal with at least the following  types of groups:

 - Finite groups.
 - Free groups of finite rank.
 - Free products of finitely many finite groups, thus in particular
   the modular group PSL(2,Z).
 - Direct products of such groups.
 - Wreath products of such groups with finite groups and with (Z,+).

Among these groups there are finitely generated groups which are not finitely
presented, and such with  unsolvable membership problem.  Further, any finite
group embeds into some divisible torsion group which RCWA can deal with.
    With the help of  this package,  the author has found  a countable simple
group which is generated by involutions interchanging disjoint  residue clas-
ses of the integers and which all the above groups embed into.
    For details on how to use the RCWA package, see the package documentation
in the `doc' subdirectory --  either view its  HTML version (chap0.html) with
a browser, or its PDF version `manual.pdf' via a PDF viewer).


                                Requirements

This version of RCWA needs at least GAP 4.4.12,  ResClasses 3.0.0, GRAPE 4.3,
Polycyclic 2.6 and GAPDoc 1.3.  All required packages are already present  in
a standard GAP installation.  RCWA can be used under UNIX,  under Windows and
on  the MacIntosh.  It is completely  written  in the  GAP language  and does
neither contain nor require  external binaries.  Warnings concerning  missing
binaries issued by GRAPE or other packages can savely be ignored.


                                Installation

Like any other GAP package,  RCWA must be installed in the pkg/  subdirectory
of the GAP distribution.  This is accomplished by extracting the distribution
file in this directory.   When you have done this you can load the package as
usual via LoadPackage( "rcwa" );.
    For further advice  on questions of technical nature please see the chap-
ter `Installation and Auxiliary Functions' in the manual.


                          Distribution and Updates

This package is distributed  with the main  GAP archive.  For updates between
releases of GAP itself check the package web page

      http://www.gap-system.org/DevelopersPages/StefanKohl/rcwa.html

or the packages' redistribution on the GAP website

      http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/rcwa.html

                                    ---

If you have problems with this package, wish to make comments or suggestions,
or if you find bugs, please send me an e-mail (stefan@mcs.st-and.ac.uk). Also
please let me know if you use RCWA in some of your work.
