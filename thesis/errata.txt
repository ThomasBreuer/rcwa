            Errata for my Thesis 'Restklassenweise affine Gruppen'
            =====================================================

                         (As known on release date.)

  @(#)$Id$

  - In Beispiele 1.1.3, Teil (1) on page 2 it must read '{(2n-1)/3,2n}'
    instead of '{(3n-1)/2,2n}'.

  - On page 79 in line 3 of Section B.1, it is wrongly claimed that in
    Beispiele 1.8.5, Teil (4) it would be conjectured that alpha and beta
    generate a free group of rank 2.
    (The conjecture itself may be true or not -- I don't know.)
 
  - On page 97 the word 'packages' in the URL of my RCWA package must be
    capitalized.
    The correct URL is http://www.gap-system.org/Packages/rcwa.html.
