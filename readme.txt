README file for `RCWA' package.

This package for GAP 4 (at least version 4.3) provides routines
for computations with [R]esidue [C]lass-[W]ise [A]ffine mappings
of the integers, hence it can be used for computations in a
certain type of infinite permutation groups.

It is completely written in the GAP language and contains /
requires no external binaries.

For the documentation, the package `GAPDoc' is needed.
The package `GRAPE' is loaded for use by the function `RcwaGraph',
if present.

The package `RCWA' must be installed in the pkg/ - subdirectory
of the GAP distribution.

After extracting the distribution file in the proper place,
you can load the package via RequirePackage( "rcwa" );
Then you can build the manual by issueing BuildRCWAManual( );.

For further advice on questions of technical nature please see
the chapter `Auxiliary functions' of the manual.

If you have problems with this package, wish to make comments
or suggestions, or if you find bugs, please send e-mail to
