                          The RCWA Package
                          ================


                              Abstract

This package for GAP (at least version 4.4) provides methods for
computations with the so-called [R]esidue [C]lass-[W]ise [A]ffine
mappings (rcwa mappings for short) and the groups generated by
bijective mappings of this type.

The rcwa mappings are a type of mappings of certain euclidian
rings R into themselves, e.g. the integers form an example for a
possible ring R. In general, the computation with arbitary mappings
from Z into Z is an algorithmically difficult task.
The rcwa mappings provide a class of mappings which are accessible
to computations.

The rcwa groups can be finite or infinite and they form a class of
subgroups of Sym(R). Their investigation is the central aim of this
package.


                            Installation

Like any other GAP package, RCWA must be installed in the pkg/
subdirectory of the GAP distribution. This is accomplished by
extracting the distribution file in this directory.
When you have done this you can load the package as usual via
LoadPackage( "rcwa" );.

Then you can build the manual by issueing RCWABuildManual( );
(this works only under UNIX, but should not be necessary unless you
got the package from CVS, since the distribution file already
contains all files produced by this function).

The RCWA Package needs at least version 4.4 of GAP, is completely
written in the GAP language and does neither contain nor require
external binaries.

Recent versions of the packages `ResClasses', `GRAPE' and `GAPDoc'
are needed. The binaries of GRAPE are not needed, thus RCWA runs
under Windows and on the MacIntosh as well. Warnings concerning
missing binaries when GRAPE is loaded can savely be ignored.

For further advice on questions of technical nature please see the
chapter `Auxiliary functions' in the manual.
