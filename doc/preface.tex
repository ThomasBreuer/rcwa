\Chapter{Preface}

This package deals with a certain kind of infinite permutations,
namely the ``residue class-wise affine'' ones.
In particular, it provides functionality for doing computations with such
mappings over the ring of integers.
In the introduction, I will give brief definitions.

It seems that there is just no literature concerning this topic,
but nevertheless I would like to mention the article of Hans
L{\accent127a}uchli and  Peter M. Neumann~\cite{LaeuchliNeumann88}, which
is a little bit related to the subject (but does not deal with any kind
of permutation groups over rings or of countable permutation groups).
\index{permutation groups!over rings} 
\index{permutation groups!countable}

I got the idea of introducing this kind of permutations resp.
representations of groups originally from my investigations concerning
the Collatz- (3n+1-) conjecture (for an annotated bibliography,
see~\cite{Lagarias98}), but now, residue class-wise affine
representations of groups seem to be an interesting topic of its own.

I would be grateful for any bug reports, comments or suggestions,
