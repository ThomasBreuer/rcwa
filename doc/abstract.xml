<Abstract>

The &RCWA; package provides methods for investigating
<E>R</E>esidue <E>C</E>lass-<E>W</E>ise <E>A</E>ffine groups
(<E>rcwa</E> groups for short) by means of computation. <P/>

Residue class-wise affine groups are permutation groups acting on the
integers, whose elements are bijective residue class-wise affine mappings.
Typically they are infinite. <P/>

A mapping <M>f: \Z \rightarrow \Z</M> is called <E>residue class-wise
affine</E> (or an <E>rcwa</E> mapping for short) if there is a positive
integer <M>m</M> such that the restrictions of <M>f</M> to the residue
classes (mod&nbsp;<M>m</M>) are all affine.
This means that for any residue class <M>r(m) \in \Z/m\Z</M> there
are coefficients <M>a_{r(m)}, b_{r(m)}, c_{r(m)} \in \Z</M> such that
the restriction of the mapping&nbsp;<M>f</M> to the set
<M>r(m) = \{{r + km | k \in \Z\}}</M> is given&nbsp;by
<Alt Only = "LaTeX">
  <Display>
    f|_{r(m)}: \ \ r(m) \rightarrow \Z, \ \ \
    n \ \mapsto \ \frac{a_{r(m)} \cdot n + b_{r(m)}}{c_{r(m)}}.
  </Display>
</Alt>
<Alt Only = "Text,HTML"><Verb>
                                        a_r(m) * n + b_r(m)
           f|_r(m):  r(m) -> Z,  n |->  -------------------.
                                              c_r(m)
</Verb></Alt>
Residue class-wise affine groups are countable. <Q>Many</Q> of them act
multiply transitively on&nbsp;<M>\Z</M> or on subsets thereof. Only
relatively basic facts about their structure are known so far. This package
is intended to serve as a tool for obtaining a better understanding of
their rich and interesting group theoretical and combinatorial structure.
<P/>

Residue class-wise affine groups can be generalized in a natural way to
euclidean rings other than the ring of integers. While this package
undoubtedly provides most functionality for residue class-wise affine groups
over the integers, at least rudimentarily it also covers the cases that the
underlying ring is a semilocalization of&nbsp;<M>\Z</M> or a polynomial ring
in one variable over a finite field. <P/>

The original motivation for investigating residue class-wise affine groups
comes from the famous <M>3n+1</M> Conjecture, which is an assertion about
a surjective, but not injective residue class-wise affine mapping. <P/>

Residue class-wise affine groups are introduced in the author's thesis
<E>Restklassenweise affine Gruppen</E>. This thesis is available at
<URL>http://deposit.ddb.de/cgi-bin/dokserv?idn=977164071</URL>
(Archivserver Deutsche Bibliothek) and at
<URL>http://elib.uni-stuttgart.de/opus/volltexte/2005/2448/</URL>
(OPUS-Datenbank Universität Stuttgart).
A copy of this thesis and an english translation thereof are distributed
with this package (see <F>thesis/thesis.pdf</F> resp.
<F>thesis/thesis&uscore;e.pdf</F>).
