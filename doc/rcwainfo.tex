\Section{The Info class of the package}

\>`RcwaInfo' V

This is the Info class of the RCWA package (see~"ref:Info Functions" 
in the {\GAP} Reference Manual for a description of the Info mechanism).

\>RCWAInfo( <n> ) F

For convenience: `RCWAInfo( <n> )' is a shorthand for
`SetInfoLevel( RcwaInfo, <n> )'.

 its order is infinite, although the validity of this criterium has not been p\
roved so far.

#I  The 4th power of IntegralRcwaMapping( [ [ 1, 0, 2 ], [ 3, 1, 2 ]

16; this is larger than the square of the modulus of the base, so we claim the\
 mapping is wild, although the validity of this criterium has not yet been pro\
